Python Experiments and Exercises
This project contains a few simple Python programming exercises, mixing tasks assigned in my LUT course and personal coding explorations. These exercises aim to help me understand basic concepts and build foundational coding skills. They also reflect my curiosity and interest in learning Python beyond the classroom.

Overview
In this repository, you’ll find:

Simple experiments with lists, loops, and basic file operations.
Several exercises involving conditionals, loops, and input handling.
Purpose
This was my first experience with programming. Through these exercises, I practiced structuring code, writing functions, and managing data in lists. The repository shows my progress as I learned to think logically and troubleshoot basic coding problems.

Getting Started
To run any of the scripts, you’ll need:

Python installed on your system.
Clone or download this repository, then run the desired script in a terminal or Python IDE.
